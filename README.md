Conway's Game of Life stands as a masterpiece in the world of cellular automata.

Created by mathematician John Conway in 1970, it demonstrates the remarkable emergence of complexity from simple rules.
With its mesmerizing patterns and profound implications for self-organization, it bridges mathematics, art, and philosophy.
This elegant interplay of simplicity and complexity continues to captivate minds,
showcasing the beauty inherent in computational exploration and the intricacies of emergent behavior.

that is the reason behind my project
unlike most versions of this game, you ,the player, are in control of the updates

giving you the chance to follow the evolution of the cells

and a deeper understanding of the mathematics of the game.
